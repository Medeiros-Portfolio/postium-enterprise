## Introduction
You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy) In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion. (Anonymous) I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal) Any fool can use a computer. Many do. (Ted Nelson)

The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) But what is it good for? (Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, commenting on the microchip, 1968) Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering) Programming is like sex: one mistake and you’re providing support for a lifetime. (Michael Sinz) I think there’s a world market for about 5 computers.

## Usage

(Grady Booch) Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more ‘user-friendly’… Their best approach so far has been to take all the old brochures and stamp the words ‘user-friendly’ on the cover. (Bill Gates) There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone. (Bjarne Stroustrup) Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding)
